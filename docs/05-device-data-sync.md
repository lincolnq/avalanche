# Device data sync & the storage service

Status: **partially implemented.** Stages 1–3 are built (server, client engine,
the `SyncedType` ergonomic bridge, trigger generation, the contacts/settings/
profile adapters, and the commit-hook scheduler); stages 4–5 (snapshots/backup
and WebSocket fast-sync) are not. See §13 for the per-stage status. Sections
marked **OPEN** are unresolved; **DECIDED** are committed. Spun out of
`docs/04-multi-device.md` §5, which got too big once the durable-state mechanism
was fleshed out.

Background reading:

- `docs/04-multi-device.md` §5 — the channel model this doc's "Durable channel" comes from; the *event* channel (sent transcripts, read marks) stays there.
- `docs/50-identity-auth-recovery.md` — the storage key, rotation key, and recovery blob this chains through.
- `docs/03-groups.md` — group master keys live in the local `groups` table; this doc syncs that table, it does not duplicate it.
- `docs/52-contacts-and-profiles.md` — contacts/profile are consumers of this service.
- `docs/35-attachments.md` — large content (avatars, files) goes to the media path; the store holds only references.
- `docs/06-identity-device-store-split.md` — the proposed split of per-device crypto from the per-identity durable store; it defines the single "identity store" that this service syncs and that stage 4 snapshots.

## 1. Scope

How a user's **durable identity state** stays consistent across all of an
identity's devices and survives total device loss. Durable state = current-value
data that isn't a message: contacts + nicknames, blocked list, group master keys,
per-conversation flags (mute/archive/pin/marked-unread), settings, and profile
pointers.

**Scope is the identity (DID), per the terminology in `00`** — not a single
`(identity, server)` account, and not across identities. This state is shared
across all of the identity's devices and *replicated* across its accounts (one
authoritative, the rest passive backups — §7); but separate identities are
deliberately isolated personas that never share durable state (so a block or mute
under one identity does not reach another — see `docs/53-multi-account-ux.md`).
Server-side, each account stores its own copy keyed by `account_id` (§5).

There are two cross-device sync channels (see `04` §5). They are different
mechanisms and this doc owns only the second:


| Channel     | Data                                | Transport                          | Owned by |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------- |
| Event       | sent transcripts, read/viewed marks | the message queue                  | `04` §5  |
| **Durable** | current-value identity state        | **the storage service (this doc)** | **here** |


Out of scope: the event channel (`04`); large content *bytes* (`35` — the store
holds references, never the bytes); the cryptographic device substrate (`04`
§§1–4).

## 2. Design goals

1. **One local source of truth.** Durable state lives in normal typed SQLCipher
  domain tables (`groups`, `contacts`, …), used directly by feature code. The
   sync layer **never duplicates the payload** — it syncs those tables in place.
2. **Adding a new synced type is trivial.** A domain table + a small adapter + a
  one-line registration, and sync/encryption/conflict/fast-sync/backup/recovery
   all work with no further code. This is the primary ergonomic goal (§3).
3. **Server sees only opaque ciphertext.** No type-awareness; enumeration and
  semantics are client-side.
4. **Tractable sync.** Single authoritative server, per-record last-writer-wins,
  no multi-master, no CRDTs, no vector clocks (§7, §9).
5. **Prompt propagation.** Push nudge + delta pull (§8).
6. **Powers linked devices and recovery** from the same mechanism (§11).

## 3. The core model: domain tables + sync sidecar + adapters

The whole design exists to make goal 2 true. Three pieces:

- **Domain tables** — the operational source of truth, owned by feature code
(e.g. `groups.master_key` lives in the `groups` table and nowhere else).
- **A generic sync engine** (§6) — syncs domain rows to/from the storage service.
It is the *only* code that talks to the server; feature code never does.
- **A thin sidecar table** — per-record sync bookkeeping (version, dirty,
tombstone). **No payload.** The payload is read from / written to the domain
table on demand.
- **An adapter per synced type** — the small glue that tells the engine how to
serialize a row and write it back. This is all a feature author writes.

### 3.1 The sidecar table

```sql
-- bookkeeping only; never holds payload (that's in the domain tables)
CREATE TABLE storage_sync (
  type        INTEGER NOT NULL,   -- TYPE_TAG: which adapter owns this record
  logical_key TEXT    NOT NULL,   -- natural key, e.g. groups.group_id
  version     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,  -- server CAS token last seen
  dirty       INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,  -- local change pending push
  deleted     INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,  -- tombstone pending push
  PRIMARY KEY (type, logical_key)
);
-- plus a single-row cursor (highest server `seq` consumed)
CREATE TABLE storage_cursor (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY CHECK (id = 1), seq INTEGER NOT NULL);
```

The opaque server-side `record_id` is recomputable from `(type, logical_key)`
(§4), so the sidecar never stores it.

### 3.2 The adapter

A feature author implements one typed trait per synced type:

```rust
/// One synced record type. Implemented once per domain table that syncs.
trait SyncedType {
    /// Stable, globally-unique, NEVER-reused tag. Part of the record_id.
    const TYPE_TAG: u16;
    type Record;

    /// Natural key (e.g. group_id, contact DID). With TYPE_TAG → record_id.
    fn logical_key(r: &Self::Record) -> String;

    /// Payload codec. Protobuf recommended for forward-compatible fields.
    fn encode(r: &Self::Record) -> Vec<u8>;
    fn decode(bytes: &[u8]) -> Result<Self::Record, StoreError>;

    /// Write-through into the domain table (apply a pulled record).
    fn upsert(store: &Store, r: &Self::Record) -> Result<(), StoreError>;
    fn delete(store: &Store, logical_key: &str) -> Result<(), StoreError>;

    /// Read a record from the domain table (build ciphertext on push).
    fn load(store: &Store, logical_key: &str) -> Result<Option<Self::Record>, StoreError>;
}
```

The engine consumes adapters through an object-safe, byte-oriented view, with a
blanket bridge from `SyncedType` so authors only ever write the typed trait:

```rust
trait SyncAdapter {                               // what the registry stores
    fn type_tag(&self) -> u16;
    /// payload = None means tombstone.
    fn apply(&self, store: &Store, logical_key: &str, payload: Option<&[u8]>) -> Result<(), StoreError>;
    fn read(&self, store: &Store, logical_key: &str) -> Result<Option<Vec<u8>>, StoreError>;
}
impl<T: SyncedType> SyncAdapter for T { /* decode→upsert / load→encode / None→delete */ }
```

### 3.3 The registry

```rust
let mut reg = SyncRegistry::new();
reg.add::<GroupKeySync>();   // TYPE_TAG = 1
reg.add::<ContactSync>();    // TYPE_TAG = 2
reg.add::<SettingsSync>();   // TYPE_TAG = 3
// …
```

The engine routes a pulled record to `reg[type].apply(...)` and, on push, asks
each registered adapter for its dirty rows. `TYPE_TAG`s are assigned from a
central enum so they're never reused (reuse would alias two types onto one
`record_id` space).

### 3.4 Dirty tracking — hands-off via triggers

Feature code must not have to *remember* to mark a row dirty. A per-table trigger
does it automatically, so feature code just writes its domain table as it always
has:

```sql
-- one set per syncable table; TYPE_TAG and key column are the only specifics
CREATE TRIGGER groups_sync_aiu AFTER INSERT ON groups BEGIN
  INSERT INTO storage_sync(type, logical_key, dirty) VALUES (1, NEW.group_id, 1)
  ON CONFLICT(type, logical_key) DO UPDATE SET dirty = 1, deleted = 0;
END;
-- AFTER UPDATE: same body
CREATE TRIGGER groups_sync_ad AFTER DELETE ON groups BEGIN
  INSERT INTO storage_sync(type, logical_key, dirty, deleted) VALUES (1, OLD.group_id, 1, 1)
  ON CONFLICT(type, logical_key) DO UPDATE SET dirty = 1, deleted = 1;
END;
```

The triggers are mechanical (only the table, `TYPE_TAG`, and key column vary), so
they can be generated from the registry rather than hand-written.

> **Why triggers and not write-wrappers?** Triggers can't be forgotten and can't
> be bypassed by a stray `UPDATE`. The cost is one boilerplate migration snippet
> per table, which is generatable. If you'd rather keep DB logic minimal, the
> alternative is routing all domain writes through a helper that touches
> `storage_sync` in the same transaction — same effect, more discipline required.

### 3.5 How to add a new synced type (the payoff)

1. **Domain table** — add it + a migration (or reuse an existing table).
2. **Adapter** — `impl SyncedType` (encode/decode/upsert/delete/load) and pick a
  fresh `TYPE_TAG` from the central enum.
3. **Register + triggers** — `reg.add::<MyTypeSync>()` and add the three
  generated triggers.

Nothing else. CAS, the cursor, conflict resolution, encryption, the push nudge,
backup snapshots, and recovery bootstrap are all handled by the engine. A type
that should *not* roam (Device-local per `04` §5 — theme, biometric lock) simply
has no adapter and no triggers.

## 4. Encryption & opacity

- **Storage key** — a 32-byte **identity-level** key (per DID — the same across
all of the identity's devices and accounts), provisioned alongside the identity
key at link time and carried in the recovery blob (§11). Never sent to any server.
The **presence of this key is the single opt-in signal** for storage sync: a
human account provisions one at creation; a bot account does not (bots are
single-instance, have no second device or recovery blob). With no key the
engine no-ops, no dirty-tracking triggers are installed, and the background
scheduler exits immediately — so an opted-out account does zero sync work and
accrues no sidecar rows.
- **Record id** — `record_id = HMAC-SHA256(storage_key, u16_be(TYPE_TAG) || logical_key)[..16]`.
Deterministic, so two devices independently address the same record without a
shared manifest; opaque, so the server learns neither type nor key.
- **Ciphertext envelope** — `version(1) || nonce(12) || AES-256-GCM(storage_key, encode(record))`,
matching the recovery-blob envelope shape. The `TYPE_TAG` is also bound as
associated data so a record can't be replayed under the wrong type.

**Opacity constraint:** because records are opaque, the server can enforce only
byte/count limits (§10), never type-aware ones, and cannot enumerate by type —
enumeration is a local query over the domain tables (which the client fully
mirrors anyway). "List my group keys" is `SELECT … FROM groups`, never a server
call.

## 5. Storage service API (server)

Per-record server-assigned `version` (CAS token) + a per-account monotonic `seq`
(the cursor space). Authoritative server only; backups speak the snapshot
endpoints only (§7).

```http
GET /v1/storage/items?since={cursor}&limit={n}        # delta (or full, since=0) pull
→ 200 { "items": [ { "record_id","version","seq","deleted","ciphertext" } ],
        "next_cursor": <int>, "has_more": <bool> }

PUT /v1/storage/items                                  # batch write, per-item CAS
  { "writes": [ { "record_id","expected_version","deleted","ciphertext" } ] }
→ 200 { "applied":   [ { "record_id","version","seq" } ],
        "conflicts": [ { "record_id","current_version" } ] }   # stale expected_version
```

`expected_version: 0` = create-if-absent. Writes apply independently; conflicts
are returned un-applied and the client re-pulls + retries those.

Snapshot side-channel for the passive backups (§7) — one whole-store blob, LWW on
`snapshot_version`:

```http
PUT /v1/storage/snapshot { "snapshot_version", "blob" }   # stored iff newer
GET /v1/storage/snapshot → 200 { "snapshot_version", "blob" } | 404
```

Server tables:

```sql
CREATE TABLE storage_items (
  account_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES accounts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  record_id  BYTEA  NOT NULL,
  version    BIGINT NOT NULL,            -- per-record CAS token
  seq        BIGINT NOT NULL,            -- per-account monotonic; cursor space
  ciphertext BYTEA  NOT NULL,
  deleted    BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
  byte_len   INTEGER NOT NULL,           -- for the running quota counter (§10)
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  PRIMARY KEY (account_id, record_id)
);
CREATE INDEX storage_items_seq ON storage_items (account_id, seq);

CREATE TABLE storage_snapshots (
  account_id       BIGINT PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES accounts(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  snapshot_version BIGINT NOT NULL,
  blob             BYTEA  NOT NULL,
  updated_at       TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);
```

The write handler runs in a `pool.begin()` transaction: CAS-check the row's
`version`, allocate `next_seq` from a per-account counter *in the same txn*,
upsert, enforce quotas (§10), return `(version, seq)`. `GET` is fetchable and
`PUT` writable, so both need rate limiting per the endpoint checklist.

Everything here is keyed by `account_id` — the `(identity, server)` account on
*this* server (per `00`). The identity-scope of the store (§1) is realized by
replicating across the identity's accounts (§7), of which only the authoritative
one is a live read/write target; the others receive snapshots.

## 6. Sync engine (client)

The only component that talks to the storage service. FFI export is sync
(blocks on the global runtime); feature code just mutates domain tables and the
triggers + engine do the rest.

```rust
fn sync(&self) -> Result<(), AppError> {
    // 1. PULL — apply everything newer than our cursor, routed by TYPE_TAG.
    let mut cursor = store.storage_cursor();
    loop {
        let page = client.storage_pull(cursor, 500)?;
        for it in &page.items {
            if it.version <= store.sync_version(it.record_id) { continue; } // LWW
            let (tag, key, payload) = decrypt_and_split(&storage_key, it)?;  // payload None if deleted
            registry[tag].apply(&store, &key, payload.as_deref())?;          // write-through to domain table
            store.set_sync_meta(tag, &key, it.version, /*dirty*/ false, it.deleted);
        }
        cursor = page.next_cursor;
        if !page.has_more { break }
    }
    store.set_storage_cursor(cursor);

    // 2. PUSH — every dirty row, built on demand from its domain table.
    let writes = store.dirty_records().iter().map(|m| {
        let payload = if m.deleted { None } else { registry[m.type].read(&store, &m.logical_key)? };
        build_write(&storage_key, m, payload)   // record_id + expected_version = m.version
    }).collect();
    let res = client.storage_push(writes)?;
    for a in res.applied   { store.set_sync_meta_clean(a.record_id, a.version); }
    for c in res.conflicts { /* leave dirty; next pull re-merges then we retry */ }
    Ok(())
}
```

Writes are local-first: a domain mutation sets `dirty` via trigger immediately;
`sync()` reconciles asynchronously. A separate periodic task serializes the full
local set and `PUT /snapshot`s it to each backup server (§7).

### 6.1 What schedules a push

The trigger and the wakeup are **two separate jobs, both global** — neither needs
any per-write-path code. Feature code just writes its domain table.


| Job                       | Mechanism                                | Wired                        |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Mark *which* row is dirty | per-table trigger (§3.4)                 | once per table (generatable) |
| Wake the sync task        | rusqlite `commit_hook` on the connection | once, at store open          |


- **Durability (the trigger's only job).** `dirty = 1` is a *persistent record of
intent*, written in the same transaction as the data — crash-atomic. If the app
dies before pushing, the bit is still there on next launch and the next `sync()`
flushes it. The trigger does no networking and wakes nothing.
- **Scheduling (the commit hook).** A single `commit_hook`, registered once when
the store opens, fires on every commit regardless of which path did the write. It
sets an in-memory "dirty exists" flag and pokes a `tokio::sync::Notify`; a
background task coalesces the burst and calls `sync()` once — the push-side mirror
of the §8 pull coalescing. (The engine's own pull write-backs also fire the hook;
since `apply` clears `dirty`, the woken `sync()` finds nothing to push and no-ops.)
- **Safety-net poll.** A periodic tick (and on foreground / WebSocket reconnect)
runs `sync()` whenever any dirty row exists. This makes the system self-healing:
a missed `Notify` still gets flushed, because the durable dirty bit outlives it.

```
feature code writes domain table
  → trigger sets dirty=1            (durable intent — survives crash)
  → commit_hook pokes sync task     (scheduling — best-effort, fast, debounced)
  → sync() reads dirty_records(), pushes, clears dirty on `applied`
  → safety-net poll catches anything the poke missed
```

Pushing inline from the write path is deliberately avoided: it would block the FFI
call on the network, fail offline, and lose crash-durability. Decoupling through
the dirty bit gives the local-first property — the write always succeeds locally,
the push happens whenever connectivity allows.

## 7. Where it lives — one authoritative account, passive backups

**DECIDED. The deliberate choice is to NOT build multi-master replication.**

The store is identity-scoped (§1) but physically hosted on the identity's
accounts — one authoritative, the rest passive:

- **On the identity's own accounts only** (the servers where the DID is
registered), never a server you don't control, always ciphertext. A seized
store server yields nothing readable.
- **One authoritative copy** — the account on your default/discovery server
(`servers[0]`), same home-and-proxy pattern as the profile blob. **All device
reads/writes go here**, so there is no cross-account divergence to reconcile.
- **The identity's other accounts (its remaining `servers`) hold passive, one-way
encrypted snapshots** — write-only backups, never read unless the authoritative
account is lost.
"Replication" is just "occasionally push a snapshot": one-directional,
conflict-free, explicitly not multi-master.

This stays tractable because the data cooperates (§9). **Cost accepted:** seizure
of the authoritative server pauses live sync until you promote a backup, and you
may lose the last few minutes of mutable changes; recovery still works from the
latest snapshot + the recovery blob.

**Backing storage:** the homeserver may persist on managed object storage
(S3/R2/GCS), as it does media — an infra detail. A *consumer* cloud (iCloud/Drive)
is **not** the substrate (it would re-centralize on a subpoenable party and leak
DID↔platform metadata, against the threat model).

### OPEN — backup placement under review (snapshot client core PARKED)

**Status: the snapshot/backup half of this section is being reconsidered. The
client `build_snapshot`/`restore_snapshot` core was written and tested but is now
PARKED (commented out in `app-core/src/storage_sync.rs`), and the periodic
backup-push + `net` snapshot client methods were never built. Do NOT re-enable
without resolving the questions below.**

The concern surfaced while wiring it: on the server, the snapshot is a **totally
different kind of storage** from the live per-record store — a separate table
(`storage_snapshots`, one opaque blob/account, LWW on `snapshot_version`, no `seq`,
no per-record CAS) versus `storage_items` (per-record CAS + per-account `seq`
cursor). The two never cross-populate, and the server has **no** authoritative-vs-
backup concept — "role" is purely client-side (`docs/06` §9), and both endpoint
families are exposed for every account.

The consequence we're unsure about: **a passive backup cannot be transparently
promoted to authoritative.** A backup has only ever received snapshot blobs, so
its `storage_items` is empty; promotion is a deliberate sequence — `GET /snapshot`
→ `restore_snapshot` locally → **re-seed** the promoted server's `/items` from
scratch → reset per-(device, server) cursors → resume live sync. That is more
machinery (and a sharper failure mode) than the original "occasionally push a
snapshot" framing implied.

Questions to settle on the next pass, before un-parking:

- Is two-storage-types + non-transparent promotion actually the right shape, or
  should backups be **first-class item stores** fed by one-way `/items`
  replication (so promotion is a no-op flip)?
- The original reason for rejecting multi-master (§9) was CAS/`seq` reconciliation
  — but records are **already independent and per-record LWW**. Does that make a
  **per-record-LWW multi-master** (or at least multi-*reader* with one-way item
  fan-out) tractable after all, removing the snapshot type entirely?
- If we keep snapshots: what's the cadence, and is "serialized item-set" vs an
  "independent re-encode" the right blob format (the §13 OPEN we punted)?
- Recovery (`§11`) currently leans on the snapshot path being load-bearing once
  group keys move out of the recovery blob — re-examine that coupling under
  whichever model wins.

The parked code (serialize-all-records-via-adapters + restore-as-pull) is kept
verbatim because the *record-level* mechanics are likely reusable regardless of
which placement model we land on; it's the **placement/promotion** design that's
in question, not the per-record seal/adapter machinery.

## 8. Fast sync (push nudge + delta pull)

§5–6 alone would be poll-only. The fast path reuses the existing per-device
WebSocket (`routes/websocket.rs`): **push carries the signal, pull carries the
data.**

1. Device A writes → server bumps `seq` to N.
2. Server nudges A's *other* connected devices: `{"storage_changed": true, "high_seq": N}` — metadata only.
3. Each device delta-pulls `since={cursor}`.

**Push is a latency optimization; correctness is the cursor pull.** Missed nudges
are harmless (idempotent pull); offline devices catch up on reconnect via the
same `since={cursor}`. **Coalescing is client-side, server does no debounce:** the
high-water `seq` makes redundant nudges near-free, and a device that gets nudges
mid-pull sets a "resync" flag and pulls once more when done — any burst collapses
to ~one extra pull. Backgrounded apps get a silent push (APNs/FCM) or sync on next
foreground. All of this is single-authoritative-server; backups are never in the
fast path.

## 9. Conflict model

**Per-record last-writer-wins**, safe here because the data cooperates:

- **Single-user, low-write, low-contention** — two of your own devices writing the
same record in the same instant is rare, and "two setting toggles, keep the
newer" is a benign resolution.
- **Records are independent** — no cross-record invariants, so no multi-record
atomicity and no transaction spanning records.
- **Most records are immutable or monotonic** — a group master key is added on
join and tombstoned on leave, never mutated; only flags/settings actually
mutate, where LWW is harmless.

So no CRDTs/OT/vector clocks. CAS on the per-record `version` + LWW on apply is
sufficient.

## 10. Limits / quotas

The governing limit is **snapshot/recovery cost** (the whole store is blobbed to
backups and pulled on recovery), not raw storage — and large content never enters
the store (it goes to the media path; the store holds only references), so records
are intrinsically small.


| Cap                       | Start    | Why                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Total bytes / account** | ~4–8 MB  | Governing limit — snapshot + recovery cost. Binds first.                    |
| **Per-record ciphertext** | ~8 KB    | Real records are <1 KB; stops a record becoming a file.                     |
| **Record count**          | ~10–25 k | Secondary guard; contacts + per-conversation flags can reach low thousands. |


Enforced server-side at `PUT` via a per-account running byte+count counter
updated in the write txn (`byte_len` column). Because records are opaque, limits
are byte/count only — any semantic ("max N contacts") limits live client-side.

## 11. Storage key, recovery blob, and bootstrap

The storage key chains the recovery blob to the store (see `04` §5.6 for the full
argument). Summary:

- **Recovery blob** (passkey-encrypted, occasional) shrinks to a keyring: identity
key, rotation derivation, server list, and **the storage key** — *not* the
durable data itself.
- **Storage key** (shared across devices) encrypts the live store.

Both bootstrap paths converge on "get the storage key, then pull the store":

- **Linking a device:** identity key + storage key arrive over the provisioning
channel (`04` §4) → engine pulls `since=0` → write-through fills every domain
table → fully operational. (No special "fetch group keys" step; the full pull is
cheap.)
- **Total-loss recovery:** passkey → decrypt recovery blob → identity key +
storage key → pull `since=0` (or promote a backup snapshot) → same.

**Coupling to note:** because group master keys moved out of the recovery blob and
into the store, the snapshot-to-backups path (§7) is now load-bearing for
total-loss recovery — it provides what the blob's inline group keys used to. The
snapshots are one-way and conflict-free, so this doesn't reintroduce multi-master.

**Recovery-blob size cap (consequence of the above).** Once group keys leave the
blob, the recovery blob is a near-**constant keyring** (identity key, rotation
derivation, server list, storage key) — a few KB, no longer growing with group
count. That makes a tight, *explicit* byte cap on `PUT /v1/recovery` both safe and
worth adding: the `GET /v1/recovery/{did}` read path is **unauthenticated** (opaque
ciphertext, fetchable by anyone who knows the DID), so an unbounded blob is a
public storage/bandwidth-abuse vector — the same concern as §10's quotas but on a
public path. Today there is no intentional cap: only a rate limit on `PUT` plus
axum's accidental 2 MB `Json` body default. Recommended: a deliberate
`MAX_RECOVERY_BLOB` constant (32–64 KB — comfortably above a keyring, far below
2 MB), enforced in the handler. **Sequencing:** the tight cap must land *with or
after* the migration that moves group keys into the store (this doc), since
today's blob still inlines a 32-byte `master_key` per group and would blow a 64 KB
cap for a heavy-membership user; until then, use a transitional cap sized for
worst-case membership.

## 12. End-to-end walkthroughs

- **Add a contact.** Feature code inserts a row into `contacts`. Trigger marks
`storage_sync(type=CONTACT, key=did)` dirty. `sync()` reads the row via the
adapter, encrypts, CAS-pushes; the server bumps `seq` and nudges your other
devices; they delta-pull and `ContactSync::upsert` writes the row into *their*
`contacts`. No feature code on the read side.
- **Join a group.** `groups.rs` writes `master_key` into the `groups` table (as it
does today). Trigger marks it dirty; `sync()` pushes it as a `GROUP_KEY` record;
other devices pull and `GroupKeySync::upsert` lands it in their `groups` table.
The key bytes exist in exactly one local table per device — `groups` — never a
duplicate.
- **Link a new device.** §11 — pull `since=0`, every adapter fills its domain
table, operational with no per-type bootstrap code.
- **Recover after losing everything.** §11 — passkey → storage key → pull.

## 13. Status & open questions

- **DECIDED:** domain-tables + sidecar + adapters (no payload duplication);
single-authoritative + passive backups; per-record LWW; client-side coalescing;
storage-key chaining; **trigger marks dirty, a single `commit_hook` schedules
the push, periodic poll is the safety net — zero per-write-path code (§6.1)**;
**triggers are generated from the `SyncRegistry` (the single source of truth for
`(table, key_column, TYPE_TAG)`) and installed at open, not hand-written**;
`TYPE_TAG`s are module constants in `app-core/src/storage_sync.rs`; **storage
sync is opt-in via storage-key presence, so bots opt out (§4)**.
- **OPEN:** snapshot cadence; whether the snapshot is a serialized item-set or an
independent re-encode; the WebSocket fast-sync nudge to *other* devices (§8).

### 13.1 Implementation status (by stage)

**Stage 1 — server `storage_items` + `/v1/storage/items` — DONE.**

- `infra/migrations/013_storage_items.sql` — `storage_items` (PK `(account_id, record_id)`, `version`/`seq`/`byte_len`/`deleted`), index `storage_items_seq`,
and a per-account `storage_seq` counter table.
- `core/crates/server/src/db/storage.rs` — `StorageItem`, `PutOutcome::{Applied, Conflict}`, `account_usage` (running byte+count quota), `pull` (cursor query),
`alloc_seq` (atomic upsert), `put_item` (CAS under `SELECT … FOR UPDATE`).
- `core/crates/server/src/routes/storage.rs` — authenticated, account-scoped
`pull_items` (GET) + `put_items` (PUT) with the §10 caps as consts
(`MAX_RECORD_BYTES` 8 KB, `MAX_TOTAL_BYTES` 8 MB, `MAX_RECORD_COUNT` 25 000,
pull limit clamped to 1000, ≤500 writes/request). Tombstones store their sealed
header verbatim (§4) rather than blanked ciphertext.
- Rate limits: `ACTION_STORAGE_PULL`/`PUSH` in
`core/crates/server/src/middleware/rate_limit.rs`. `delete_account` now also
purges `storage_items` + `storage_seq` (`db/accounts.rs`).
- Tests: 8 db + 4 http storage tests (`server/tests/{db,http}_tests.rs`).

**Stage 2 — client sidecar + engine + group-key adapter — DONE.**

- Sidecar schema (`storage_sync`, `storage_cursor`, `storage_key_state`) and the
three `groups` dirty-tracking triggers (TYPE_TAG 1) in
`core/crates/store/src/schema.rs`; sidecar accessors in
`core/crates/store/src/storage_sync.rs`.
- `core/crates/net/src/lib.rs` — `storage_pull`/`storage_push` + wire types.
- `core/crates/app-core/src/storage_sync.rs` — record crypto (§4: `record_id`
HMAC, `seal`/`open` with the `tag‖key_len‖logical_key‖payload` plaintext
layout), `SyncAdapter` trait + `SyncRegistry`, `GroupKeyAdapter`, and the
`sync`/`pull`/`push` engine.
- Storage-key provisioning: generated at account creation, carried in the
recovery blob (`storage_key` field added to `proto/recovery.proto`;
`build_recovery_blob` in `app-core/src/recovery.rs`), and restored on recover
(`app-core/src/lib.rs`).
- FFI: `sync_storage` (sync export) + `sync_storage_async`
(`app-core/src/lib.rs`); iOS picks it up via the no-op default in
`mobile/.../AppCoreProtocol+Defaults.swift`.
- Tests: store sidecar tests (`store/tests/store_tests.rs`) + the push→pull
restore e2e (`app-core/tests/e2e_storage.rs`).

**Stage 3 — ergonomics, trigger generation, more adapters, scheduler — DONE.**

- `SyncedType` typed trait + blanket `impl<T: SyncedType> SyncAdapter for T`
(`app-core/src/storage_sync.rs`) — the §3.2 "primary ergonomic goal". Authors
write only the typed trait (`encode`/`decode` on the payload, `upsert`/`delete`/
`load` on the store); `GroupKeyAdapter` is rewritten onto it. The engine still
only ever stores `dyn SyncAdapter`. Note: the doc's `logical_key(&Record)` is
dropped — the engine carries the key from the sealed header + sidecar, so it is
unused; `decode` instead receives the logical key.
- **Trigger generation** — `store::storage_sync::SyncTriggerSpec` +
`Store::install_sync_triggers` generate the three `AFTER INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE`
triggers per type from the registry (`SyncRegistry::trigger_specs`). The
hand-written `groups_sync_`* triggers are removed from `schema.rs`. Installed at
account open via `storage_sync::ensure_triggers`, **gated on the storage key
being present** (so opted-out accounts get none — §4).
- **New adapters** — `ContactAdapter` (tag 2, `contacts`), `ConvSettingsAdapter`
(tag 3, `conversation_settings`), `ContactProfileAdapter` (tag 4,
`contact_profiles`). Contacts roam as **curation + profile**: two synced types
keyed by the same DID (the curated row, and the name/profile_key), preserving
the one-table-per-`SyncedType` invariant. New store methods: `delete_contact`,
`load_conversation_settings`/`delete_conversation_settings`,
`delete_contact_profile`.
- **Commit-hook scheduler** (§6.1) — `Store::set_commit_hook` (rusqlite `hooks`
feature) pokes `AppCore::sync_notify` on every committed local write;
`storage_sync::run_scheduler` (spawned like `start_reconnect_task` —
`spawn_blocking` + current-thread runtime + `Weak`, since store futures aren't
`Send`) debounces the burst and runs `sync()`, with a 60 s safety-net poll. Spin
is avoided by `set_storage_cursor` no-op-ing on an unchanged value, so a settled
sync commits nothing and the loop quiesces. The scheduler is started only on the
human FFI constructors and exits immediately for an opted-out account.
- **Bot opt-out** (new, §4) — storage-key provisioning is gated on `!is_bot`; key
presence then gates triggers, the scheduler, and the engine.
- Tests: adapter codecs + bridge routing + registry/trigger-spec unit tests
(`app-core`), `install_sync_triggers` + cursor-guard store tests, and a contact +
profile + conversation-timer e2e round-trip (`e2e_storage.rs`).

**Stage 4 — snapshot endpoints (server) — DONE; client backup push — NOT YET BUILT.**

- Server side (§5/§7) is implemented:
  - `infra/migrations/014_storage_snapshots.sql` — `storage_snapshots`
  (PK `account_id`, `snapshot_version`/`blob`/`updated_at`).
  - `core/crates/server/src/db/storage.rs` — `Snapshot`,
  `SnapshotOutcome::{Stored, Stale}`, `get_snapshot`, `put_snapshot` (LWW on
  `snapshot_version` via a single `ON CONFLICT … WHERE EXCLUDED.snapshot_version
  > …` upsert; a stale push leaves the held blob untouched).
  - `core/crates/server/src/routes/storage.rs` — authenticated, account-scoped
  `GET /v1/storage/snapshot` (→ `{snapshot_version, blob}` | 404) and
  `PUT /v1/storage/snapshot` (→ `{stored, snapshot_version}`). The PUT route
  raises the body limit above axum's 2 MB default (snapshots are the whole
  store) and caps the blob at `MAX_SNAPSHOT_BYTES` (12 MB).
  - Rate limits `ACTION_STORAGE_SNAPSHOT_GET`/`PUT` (60/hr) in
  `middleware/rate_limit.rs`; `delete_account` purges `storage_snapshots`.
  - Tests: 3 db + 4 http snapshot tests (`server/tests/{db,http}_tests.rs`).
- **Client `build_snapshot`/`restore_snapshot`: written + tested, now PARKED**
(commented out in `app-core/src/storage_sync.rs`) pending the backup-placement
redesign — see the §7 "OPEN — backup placement under review" note. The periodic
backup-push task and the `net` snapshot client methods (`GET`/`PUT /v1/storage/
snapshot`) were never built. Until this is resolved, recovery relies on the
authoritative account's live items only, even though the server can hold a
snapshot.
- (5) Fast-sync nudge on the WebSocket (§8) — **DONE.** A `StorageChangedNotification`
`WsFrame` variant + `WsPush::StorageChanged`: after a `PUT /v1/storage/items`
applies, the server pushes a nudge to the account's *other* connected devices
(never the writer), and the client receive loop responds with a delta pull. The
commit-hook scheduler still covers the *push* side and the 60 s safety-net poll
remains the fallback for a missed nudge. (Tests: `storage_put_nudges_other_devices_not_writer`.)

### 13.2 Known gaps / deferred

- The §11 total-loss recovery path is not covered by an automated e2e test
(`recover_from_blob` is an FFI constructor, so a nested `block_on` can't run
inside an async test; needs a `recover_*_async` harness).
- The §11 `MAX_RECOVERY_BLOB` cap is not yet enforced; the blob now carries the
storage key but group keys still inline a `master_key` per group, so the tight
cap must wait until group-key sync is the sole path (see §11 sequencing note).
